# Financial--Report-Analyzer.
AI-powered financial document intelligence system. Ingests SEC 10-K filings, builds vector search with ChromaDB, enables natural language Q&amp;A via Groq LLM. Features automated ratio calculation, peer comparison, trend visualization, and red flag detection for management discussion patterns. Built for equity research and fundamental analysis.
Project Overview
FinSight is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system designed for equity research analysts, portfolio managers, retail investors, and business journalists. It ingests company annual reports (SEC 10-K filings), processes Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) sections, and enables intelligent natural language querying with source citations.




Key Capabilities:
🔍 Natural language Q&A over financial documents
📊 Automated financial ratio calculation & trend visualization
⚖️ Peer comparison across companies
🚩 Red flag detection for concerning management language patterns
📈 Interactive Plotly charts for margin trends

🚀 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+
Groq API key (free tier available at console.groq.com)
Step 1: Clone & Install
bash
Copy
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd finsight
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Configure API Key
Set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
bash
Copy

# Linux/Mac
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk-your-key-here"

# Windows
set GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-your-key-here
Or add it to Replit Secrets / Streamlit Cloud secrets.
Step 3: Prepare Data
Extract Item 7 (MD&A) sections from 10-K filings:
Python
Copy
# In Google Colab or local environment
from sec_edgar_downloader import Downloader
import PyPDF2, re

# Download filings
dl = Downloader("YourName", "your@email.com")
for ticker in ["AAPL", "AMZN", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA"]:
    dl.get("10-K", ticker, limit=2)

# Extract Item 7 text (see ingestion scripts)
# Save to data/text/{TICKER}_2024_item7.txt
Step 4: Run Application
bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

📊 Financial Data
Hardcoded financials (2022-2024) for ratio calculations:
Table
Company	Revenue (2024)	Operating Margin	Net Margin
AAPL	$391B	31.5%	24.0%
AMZN	$638B	9.2%	9.3%
GOOGL	$350B	28.3%	23.6%

Source: Yahoo Finance / SEC 10-K filings
🚩 Red Flag Detection
The system scans MD&A text for concerning linguistic patterns:
Table
Pattern Type	Example	Severity
Vague Attribution	"due to certain market factors"	2/5
Temporal Vagueness	"in the foreseeable future"	2/5
Passive Deflection	"was impacted by external conditions"	2/5
Accounting Euphemism	"non-recurring restructuring charge"	3/5
Guidance Softening	"withdrawing forward guidance"	3/5
🎓 Academic Context
Project Type: Internship Major Project
Institution: [Your University Name]
Duration: 6-Day Sprint
Deadline: May 31, 2026
Learning Outcomes:
RAG pipeline construction with vector databases
LLM integration for domain-specific Q&A
Financial statement analysis and ratio computation
Pattern recognition in unstructured text
Interactive data visualization
🔒 Privacy & Compliance
All data used is publicly available from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). No private company data is accessed. This project complies with:
SEC EDGAR fair access policies
Groq API terms of service
Open-source license requirements (MIT/Apache 2.0 dependencies)
⚠️ Known Limitations
Storage Constraints: NVIDIA (NVDA) excluded from some deployments due to Replit 1GB storage limit
Single-Year Text: Current implementation uses 2024 MD&A only; multi-year RAG requires additional ingestion
Hardcoded Financials: Ratio data manually extracted; production would use automated XBRL parsing
English Only: Pattern detection optimized for English SEC filings
Mitigation: Architecture supports N companies and multi-year ingestion via configuration changes.
🔮 Future Enhancements
[ ] Real-time 10-Q quarterly ingestion via SEC RSS feeds
[ ] Automated XBRL financial data extraction
[ ] Fine-tuned FinBERT sentiment analysis
[ ] Multi-year temporal RAG (compare 2022 vs 2024 language)
[ ] PDF table extraction with Camelot/Tabula
[ ] User authentication and portfolio tracking
[ ] Alert system for new red flags in filings
